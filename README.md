🏡 End-to-End House Price Prediction Using Supervised Regression Models and Web-Based Deployment

A complete Machine Learning + Flask web application that predicts house prices using key property parameters such as area, quality, bedrooms, bathrooms, and garage capacity.

This project demonstrates a full end-to-end ML deployment pipeline — from data preprocessing → model training → saving the model → Flask integration → UI for prediction.

🚀 Features

✔ Interactive web UI for entering house details

✔ ML model trained using real housing data

✔ End-to-end pipeline: preprocessing → training → deployment

✔ Fast predictions powered by Flask backend

✔ Clean input form + result page

✔ Beginner-friendly and portfolio-ready

🧠 Machine Learning Workflow
📌 Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values

Removed outliers

Encoded categorical features

Applied feature scaling

Train-test split

📌 Model Training

Models used: Linear Regression / Random Forest

Evaluated using R² Score, Mean Squared Error

📌 Model Saving

Used pickle to serialize the trained model

Flask loads the model for instant predictions
